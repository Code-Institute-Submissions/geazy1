# G-eazy

Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This website is dedicated to the Raper G-eazy fans, who want to listen to his music or follow him around the world to his best and latest concerts ! and there is even a merchandise page dedicate it to them who want to take it to the next level.
The site includes a bit of himself, tours, latest music, and merchandise.


## UX

The website's goal is to target the audience in the easiest mode possible. The dark colours theme makes it even more modern and sleek.

User story.
Because I expect as a costumer I want this app/webpage to be stable.
As a frequent shopper and rap music listener, I want to purchase and listen to music without hassle.


## Features

# Existing Features

- This site uses the 'smooth scrolling' effect.
- The navbar changes color when the user scrolls down so it can be much easier to see what it clicks. On mobile, the navigation background turns black and spacing between text
- With the help of the navbar, the user can easily walk around the website with the help of smooth scrolling.
- The user will go to the top regardless where he is on the page by clicking on the "G-eazy" logo from the navbar.
- The user can easily see where is the next concert by looking at the table list and the user can see when is the next concert.
- The user can easily buy the last tickets.
- The user can watch and listen to the last albums.
- The user can listen to the main song on the album by clicking the mp3 song under the album and video area.
- The "contact me " section is under the " Collaborations " section where the user can send a song idea.
# Features Left to Implement

## Testing

The user can read about the rapper and even see him on the background of the main page and other pages on the site.
They can view both the live version and the GitHub repository by clicking on the Font Awesome icons. They are also able to view the social media profiles via clicking on the icons in the footer. All links will open in a new tab using.
By clicking on the links in the navbar, the smooth scroll effect will work regardless of whether or not you're viewing the sections in the same order they are listed in the navbar.

When testing the mobile app I came across an issue, the menu had to little space between the text and the background was transparent, witch in my perspective that is poor UX design. The user should be able to press any button on the screen without
the user discomfort by mistakenly clicking something else ( I would not like that either ) so I did the background black and added more space between the text.
